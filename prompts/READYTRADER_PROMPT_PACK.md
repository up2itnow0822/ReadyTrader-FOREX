## ReadyTrader-Crypto Prompt Pack (Phase 6)

These are copy/paste prompts you can drop into Agent Zero, Claude, or any MCP-capable agent.

______________________________________________________________________

## Prompt 1 — 10-minute paper-mode evaluation

You have access to the ReadyTrader-Crypto MCP server. We are in PAPER_MODE=true.

Goals:

- Validate you can use the tools safely
- Produce a short “operator report” that proves the system works

Steps:

1. Call `get_health()` and summarize anything non-OK.
1. Call `deposit_paper_funds("USDC", 10000)` for user `agent_zero`.
1. Place a paper limit order: `place_limit_order("buy", "ETH/USDT", 1.0, 2000.0)`.
1. Call `check_orders("ETH/USDT")` until the order is filled (or explain why it won’t fill).
1. Call `get_address_balance("0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "paper")` if available, and/or report balances using paper tools.
1. Produce a final summary with:
   - final balances
   - portfolio value (if available)
   - any risk blocks encountered

Constraints:

- Do not attempt live trading.
- If you hit an error, call `get_health()` again and include the error code + message.

## Prompt 2 — Synthetic Stress Lab (deterministic)

We are in PAPER_MODE=true. I will provide strategy code. You will:

- run `run_synthetic_stress_test(strategy_code, config_json)`
- summarize tail risk and regime failures
- output recommended settings

Use this config as a baseline:

```json
{
  "master_seed": 1337,
  "scenarios": 200,
  "length": 500,
  "timeframe": "1h",
  "initial_capital": 10000,
  "start_price": 100,
  "base_vol": 0.015,
  "black_swan_prob": 0.03,
  "parabolic_prob": 0.03
}
```

Output requirements:

- Show max drawdown stats (p95 + max) and return tail (p05).
- List the worst-case seed(s) and their event metadata.
- Provide parameter recommendations (and explain what failure mode they address).

## Prompt 3 — Live trading preflight (DO NOT EXECUTE TRADES)

We are preparing for live mode, but you must not place any live orders or sign transactions.

Tasks:

1. Call `get_health()` and check:
   - trading halted state
   - policy allowlists/limits
   - signer configuration safety (address allowlist, signer policy)
1. Call `get_advanced_risk_disclosure()` but do not accept it.
1. Output a “go/no-go” checklist and what env vars the operator should set before enabling live trading.
